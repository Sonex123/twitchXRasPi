For using the main.py, you need a config.toml that contains following:

botname = '' #The Name of the Account, wich should be the Bot
token = '' #A OAuth Token of the Bot-Account
channelname = '' #The Channel, wich chat should be used for commands


Further you need a Raspberry Pi (i used a 4B), where the code is running on. Test wich GPIO pins you want to use and change the pins at the top of code.
